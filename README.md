# Email Assistant

## Overview

The Email Assistant project is a tool designed to automate email processing and response generation based on received emails. It leverages various technologies including Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning models, and email APIs to provide an efficient email management solution.

## Features

- Automated email processing: The Email Assistant automatically reads incoming emails, extracts relevant information, and generates appropriate responses.
- Attachment handling: It can handle attachments such as PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files, extracting text data for analysis.
- Intelligent response generation: Utilizes AI models to generate responses tailored to the content of the email.
- Periodic operation: Runs periodically to continuously monitor and respond to incoming emails.
- Logging: Keeps track of email processing activities for debugging and analysis purposes.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Obtain API keys and credentials for any required services (e.g., Gmail API).
4. Set up the environment variables as needed.
5. Run the main script (`main.py`) to start the email processing and response generation.

## Usage

1. Configure the email account credentials and settings in the `config.py` file.
2. Customize the prompt messages and persona for response generation in the main script.
3. Run the script and let it handle incoming emails automatically.
4. Monitor the log files (`emailBot.log`) for any errors or issues.

## Use Cases

- Customer support: Automatically respond to common customer inquiries or support tickets via email.
- Document processing: Extract text data from attachments and provide summaries or analysis reports.
- Task automation: Integrate with other workflows or systems to trigger actions based on received emails.
- Personal email assistant: Manage personal email accounts more efficiently by automating repetitive tasks.
